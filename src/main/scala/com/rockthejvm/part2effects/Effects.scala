  *   Concretely: an `effect` is a `data type` that embodies the concept of a) a

  *   Abstractly: the concept of a purely functional program may be defined as a
  *   giant expression that can very easily be replaced w/ the value it
  *   evaluates to (referential transparency). eg (expr --> value) == (value -->
  *   expr)
